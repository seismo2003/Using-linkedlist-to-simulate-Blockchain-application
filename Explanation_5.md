Explanation on problem 5 - Blockchain

I applied the linkedlist knowledge I've learned during the course and completed
the Blockchain class. Once I input a data, SHA256 code and utc time-stamp will
be generated at the same time and start constructing a Blockchain linkedlist. There's
no recursion or iteration being used at here, so the run time is O(1)

Space complexity of blockchain will be: O(blocks), since the output will only
be generated once the paths are found
